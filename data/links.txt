The datasets can be found in the following links:

Diginetica: competitions.codalab.org/competitions/11161#learn_the_details_data2
Retailrocket: kaggle.com/datasets/retailrocket/ecommerce-dataset

The respective data needs to be placed in the "raw" subdirectories of each dataset.
The same logic applies to new datasets.
